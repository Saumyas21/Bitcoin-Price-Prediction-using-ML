# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-ML
   In this project, we are using machine learning techniques to predict Bitcoin prices. The primary objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning models to determine which one consistently achieves the highest accuracy.
   Bitcoin is renowned for its price volatility, making it an intriguing subject for analysis. By applying machine learning methods to historical price data and relevant features, we aim to develop predictive models that offer insights into future Bitcoin price trends. The project involves several key steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, model selection, feature engineering, training and testing, model comparison, and visualization of predictions compared to actual Bitcoin prices. The project's significance lies in its potential to guide investment strategies, aid in risk management for cryptocurrency portfolios, contribute to a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics, and evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning methods in predicting volatile asset prices.
